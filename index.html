          <p>My name is Mateus dos Santos, I'm 20 years old, I'm currently studying for a bachelor's degree in Computer
            Science at Euripides of Mar√≠lia University (UNIVEM).I'm living here right now, I'm always looking for new
            opportunities and experiences that can add to my professional journey. I am passionate about programming 
            and technology in general.</p><br>

            <p>I've been studying programming since the beginning of 2020, I started with Python and soon after I 
                started to delve deeper into topics related to the web, one of the things that made me apply myself
                so much was the issue of design, which has always been an area that I really wanted to learn, after
                all it was one of my two choices of college courses that I would like to take :)</p>
